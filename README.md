## Overview

This repository hosts the supplementary materials, datasets, and visual outputs for **Chapter 3** of the PhD dissertation titled above.

The primary objective of this research was to construct a comprehensive, unified digital landscape of **Permitted Land Uses (PLU)** for the Greater Toronto-Hamilton Area (GTHA). To achieve this, this study harmonized fragmented Zoning By-Laws (ZBLs) from 26 distinct municipalities into a single "Unified Taxonomy" and utilized a hierarchical machine learning framework (XGBoost) to classify over 1.7 million land parcels.

This repository provides detailed mapping outputs, the consolidated regulatory summaries used for ground-truth labeling, and the raw regulatory documents collected during the study.

## Repository Contents

### 1. `OutputMaps_Consolidated.pdf`
A consolidated visual atlas containing the final output maps generated by the project. This document visualizes the spatial distribution of permitted land uses across the entire GTHA region for the following categories:
* Retail
* Industrial
* Office
* Residential Low/Medium Density
* Residential Apartment (High Density)
* Others (Institutional, Open Space, etc.)

### 2. `GTHA_ZBL_Summary.pdf`
A comprehensive reference document summarizing the raw zoning by-law definitions for the municipalities in the GTHA. This file serves as the "translation key" developed for this dissertation, mapping local municipal zoning codes to the project's unified land use categories. It includes data for:
* **Regional Municipalities:** Peel, Halton, York, Durham.
* **Single-Tier/Cities:** Toronto, Hamilton.
* **Local Municipalities:** Detailed breakdown for towns such as Oakville, Milton, Newmarket, etc.

### 3. `/Output_Maps_Individual/` (Folder)
High-resolution image files for the six consolidated maps found in the atlas. These are provided for easier inspection or use in presentations:
* `Map_Retail.png`
* `Map_Industrial.png`
* `Map_Office.png`
* `Map_Res_LowMed.png` (Detached, Semi-detached, Townhouse)
* `Map_Res_Apartment.png` (Apartments, Condos, High-rise)
* `Map_Others.png` (Utility, Open Space, Institutional, Recreational, Etc.)

### 4. `/Raw_ZBL_Documents/` (Folder)
A repository of the original source documents collected and analyzed for this project.
* **Zoning By-Laws (ZBLs):** Contains the official ZBL documents for 25 municipalities in the GTHA as of the data collection cutoff (2023).
* **Richmond Hill Exception:** As the City of Richmond Hill did not have a consolidated ZBL available at the time of research, this folder includes their **2022 Official Plan**, which served as the proxy for regulatory analysis. Note: The consolidated ZBL of the City of Richmond Hill was still under review by the end of 2025.

## The Unified Taxonomy

To address the inconsistency in zoning standards across the region (e.g., Toronto's "Commercial Residential" vs. Markham's "Neighbourhood Commercial"), this project standardized regulations into six high-level categories. The maps in this repository reflect these harmonized definitions:

| Unified Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Residential (Low/Med)** | Includes Single Detached, Semi-Detached, Townhouses, and other low-rise structures. |
| **Residential (Apartment)** | Designated for high-density properties such as condos and apartments. |
| **Retail** | Areas permitting stores, restaurants, service shops, and grocery outlets. |
| **Office** | Indoor workplaces including banks, corporate offices, and financial institutions. |
| **Industrial** | Manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, and logistics facilities. |
| **Others** | Institutional buildings, open spaces, utilities, and natural reserves. |
